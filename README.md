# BBDN-UEF-Python

This project is set up to demonstrate the use of the Ultra Extension Framework with LTI 1.3 in Python.

To configure:

## configs/lti.json and configs/private.key

This [document](https://docs.blackboard.com/standards/lti/tutorials/py-lti-1p3) shows how to configure the PyLTI1.3 library, which is done through the `configs`directory.

## ConfigTemplate.py

Copy `ConfigTemplate.py` to `Config.py` and fill in your information:

```
config = {
    "verify_certs" : "True",
    "learn_rest_url" : "YOURLEARNSERVERNOHTTPS",
    "learn_rest_key" : "YOURLEARNRESTKEY",
    "learn_rest_secret" : "YOURLEARNRESTSECRET",
    "app_url" : "YOURAPPURLWITHHTTPS"
}

courses = {
    "_143_1" : "UEF Pilot Cohort"
}

courseIds = '_143_1'

contents = {
    "_3127_1" : "Demo the UEF Python Example"
}

contentIds = '_3127_1'
```

* **learn_rest_url** should be set to your learn instances domain. Be sure to avoid the request scheme, i.e. `mylearn.blackboard.edu`
* **app_url** should be set to the FQDN of your application, i.e. `https://myapp.herokuapp.com`
* **courses** maps the course Pk1 to the title you wish to to assign it
* **courseIds** is a comma-delimeted list of course ids to listen for events from
* **contents** maps content pk1 values to the title you wish to assign it
* **contentIds** is a comman-delimited list of content Ids to listen for events from

## To Run

First run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  and then `python app.py` or if you are using heroku, just check in the code to your dyno.
